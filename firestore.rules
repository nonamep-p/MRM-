/**
 * @fileoverview Firestore Security Rules for VoyageVista Travel Agency.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset focuses on providing public read access to travel packages
 * while restricting access to contact form submissions to authenticated admins only.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * - /travelPackages/{travelPackageId}: Publicly accessible travel package data.
 * - /contactFormSubmissions/{contactFormSubmissionId}: Contact form submission data accessible only to admins.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Travel packages are publicly readable to allow showcasing travel options.
 * - Contact form submissions are restricted to admins to protect user data.
 * - The rules do not enforce strict schema validation in this prototyping phase.
